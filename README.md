# Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics

This is the repository for the code files of the **Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics** lecture at the [Robotics and Perception Group](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html) at UZH for ETH Zurich taught by Prof. Dr. Davide Scaramuzza. The lecture covered the following topics

- Image formation
- Filtering
- Feature extraction
- Multiple view geometry
- Dense reconstruction
- Tracking
- Image retrieval
- Event-based vision
- Visual-inertial odometry
- Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM)
- Deep Learning for Computer Vision
  
The repository contains a folder with the code to the problem sets as well as the code to the (optional) capstone project, where all of the theoretical knowledge of the lecture had to be applied. The optional capstone project features an implementation of a visual-odometry pipeline.
